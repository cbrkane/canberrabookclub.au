## Where else are we?

We started on Meetup.com but they increased the fees to a point that it is not viable for a little community book club (500 AUD/year!!!!). We are deleting the Meetup as of July 2025 so any book clubs you find on there are not us! 

Besides keeping up to date with the [RSS](/feed/rss.xml) and [ical](/feed/events.ics) feeds on this website you can still keep in touch with us on the below services.
