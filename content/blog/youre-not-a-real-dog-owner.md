## Review

This is a quick little book composed of standalone comics about common scenarios that dog owners find themselves in. 

I found most of the comics very relatable and humorous but I do agree with some of the other reviews that the mini stories in the middle didn't make much sense. 

There isn't much to say about this one but it would make a good coffee table gift for any dog owner. Check it out if you see it in your local book store!
