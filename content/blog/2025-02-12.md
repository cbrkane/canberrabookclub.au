Come along to the first book club of the year.... where you arent at risk of being swallowed by hail. Anyone who didn't weather the storm now has twice as many books to talk about.

As always we will be hosting this at Cypher brewery in Gungahlin and we usually have dinner together at the brewery; but, there is no obligation to order anything.

## Details

- When: Wednesday, February 12, 2025 5:30 PM
