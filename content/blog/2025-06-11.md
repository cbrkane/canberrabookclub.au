As always we will be hosting this at Cypher brewery in Gungahlin and we usually have dinner together at the brewery; but, there is no obligation to order anything.

Starting this month we will have an optional theme that you can try to align with for bonus imaginary CBBC points and to ensure you share a theme with others to talk about. As always you can read whatever book and genre you want though - the more diversity the better!

This month celebrates National Reconciliation Week (27 May - 3rd June) as well as World Environment Day (5th June), so start thinking about our connection to the land we live on and the original custodians.
