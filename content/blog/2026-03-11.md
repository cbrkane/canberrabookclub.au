Welcome back for another year of books and fun! I hope to see some fat stacks of books from all your summer reading. 

As always we will be hosting this at Cypher brewery in Gungahlin.

We usually have dinner together at the brewery; but, there is no obligation to order anything.
The menu is available [here](https://www.cypherbrewing.com.au/food) if you want to take a look.
